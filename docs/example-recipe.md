## Recipe Page Instructions

This is an example recipe page, generated from page's front matter. You can make a single page using this layout, or you can use it in your blog by specifying the layout as recipe instead of post. 

You probably want to hide the sidebar, so the recipe takes up the whole page width. If you add any additional content to the page it will appear below the recipe details. 

Create a list in the front matter for the ingredients, then the method steps and it will automatically be added to the page.

The front matter will also be added to the page as schema data that is used by search engines. Please see the below example for all of the schema options available.
