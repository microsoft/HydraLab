We are happy to hear your ideas for the future of Hydra Lab. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/Hydra-Lab/issues) and see if others have submitted similar issue. You can upvote existing issue or submit a new suggestion.

We always look at upvoted items in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/Hydra-Lab/issues) when we decide what to work on next, and we look forward to hearing your input. Remember that all community interactions must abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/microsoft/Hydra-Lab/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Making changes to the code

### Preparing your development environment

To learn how to build the code and run tests, follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/microsoft/Hydra-Lab/blob/main/README.md).

### Git workflow

Calculator uses the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) where most
development happens directly on the `master` branch. The `master` branch should always be in a
healthy state which is ready for release.

If your change is complex, please clean up the branch history before submitting a pull request.
You can use [git rebase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/rebase#squash-local-commits)
to group your changes into a small number of commits which we can review one at a time.

When completing a pull request, we will generally squash your changes into a single commit. Please
let us know if your pull request needs to be merged as separate commits.

## Review Process

After submitting a pull request, members of the Hydra Lab team will review your code. We will assign the request to an appropriate reviewer. Any member of the community may participate in the review, but at least one member of the Hydra Lab team will ultimately approve the request.

Often, multiple iterations will be needed to responding to feedback from reviewers. Try looking at [past pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/Hydra-Lab/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) to see what the experience might be like.
